# Backend start up instruction

## Running on local python environment
If you already have python installed, simple go to the directly `/backend` with the following command and run `app.py`. 

```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

Note that you need to install the modules listed in `requirements.txt` by the following command. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Swagger UI
You can check the responses of the endpoints directly on SwaggerUI (without any frontend).

Not that first you need the server running. (i.e., after running `app.py`)
