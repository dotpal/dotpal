[Design]
- Don't dig into objects because they know how to do it more efficiently than you do
	- Given this, things should be well-exposed, and the exposed functions define the toolset
	- Fetch-based, not push-based
- Things that are dependent on each other in some way shouldn't describe that dependent behavior in different files, for example, settings and blub create button are being created in different files, but thats wrong, because the design of those two things depend on one another. so they should be created from a centralized location. Which also makes sense because it describes "dotpal" or "dotpal interface," not user & blub
